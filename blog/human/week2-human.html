        <strong> What is your long-term goal or career pathway? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to build a career in software. I'm excited about the possibilities
        this field offers and look forward to the journey ahead.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning can pose challenges for me, particularly my ability to focus
        and manage time effectively. However, a strength of mine lies in
        thorough research, which allows me to achieve a deep understanding of
        topics.

          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to enhance my collaboration skills on projects and establish
        better time management skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maintaining clear communication with teammates and facilitators, while
        being considerate of each others learning journey. Fostering
        collaboration among teammates, acknowledging both their strengths and
        areas where they may need support.

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fortunate to have the support of my boyfriend, who is a software
        developer. During the HTML and CSS week, it was challenging and I was
        struggling a lot, feeling frustrated and doubting my work. He reassured
        me that my efforts weren't as bad as I thought, encouraging me to keep
        practicing and refining my skills. Additionally, it's beneficial to
        connect with others in the course during stressful times like this.
        Sharing experiences and learning together can be really helpful. When
        things become overwhelming, I find it most effective to confront them
        directly. Breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps helps me
        stay focused and organized in completing what I need to do.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I will proactively ask questions and seek help from facilitators, peers,
        and online resources whenever I encounter difficulties.
      </p>

          >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Someone helpful and respectful.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I do not have any commitments that would interfere with my
        learning schedule.
