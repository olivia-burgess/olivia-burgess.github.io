          >Question: Explain a situation where you have made an ethical
          decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
          decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision
          now.</strong

        Answer: During my time at the Salvation Army, I came across several
        hundred dollars concealed among donated old sheets. Despite the
        temptation to keep the money, which briefly crossed my mind, I knew
        without hesitation that the right course of action was to hand it over
        to the authorities for its rightful owner to reclaim. Reflecting on this
        decision, I am grateful that I chose honesty over personal gain. Keeping
        the money would have weighed heavily on my conscience and likely brought
        about negative consequences.

      <p>
        <strong>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        My dad had influenced me with the way he will do anything for my brother
        and I. Most people donâ€™t understand how much he looks after family but
        he takes his role as provider so seriously. Even now we are adults, he
        wants to make sure we have everything we need. Also my extended family
        is large, I have a lot of cousins, aunties and uncles. We all grew up
        together and our mums are like each other's mums. There is no better
        connection than the family that you grew up with. Everyone is going to
        look after each other and be there for them. This influences my values a
        lot and I think I am more kind towards others because of this. This
        gives me an identity of community and helping others.
      </p>

        <strong>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>According to viacharacter.org, my top three strengths are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Appreciation of Beauty & Excellence</li>
        <li>Kindness</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These strengths will support me on my learning journey by enabling me to
        appreciate excellence in both myself and others. They will also foster
        kindness and creative ideas in my approach to project work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my limitations is time management and focus, which I find
        challenging. This difficulty can impact my ability to complete tasks on
        time and collaborate effectively with others. Writing is another area
        where I struggle and sometimes feel embarrassed, but I can utilize tools
        like ChatGPT to assist me. To overcome these limitations, I will need to
        be persistent and find strategies that help me stay organized and
        focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In previous projects, I've encountered situations where some team
        members weren't pulling their weight, which impacted overall
        productivity. This distracted me from focusing on my own tasks as I
        worried about others' responsibilities being unmet. Looking back, I
        realize my approach was too gentle and ineffective in addressing the
        issue. I would now take a more direct approach, clearly communicating
        expectations and deadlines. For instance, I would directly inquire about
        incomplete tasks, asking for explanations and offering collaboration if
        needed. Additionally, I would implement progress monitoring to ensure
        better project management and timely completion of tasks.
