      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage
        my own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It involves being
        aware of my feelings, being able to regulate them, and using this
        awareness to manage my interactions with others effectively. EQ is
        crucial for building strong relationships, making informed decisions,
        and navigating social complexities with empathy and understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the Difference Between EQ and IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        EQ and IQ are often compared but serve different purposes. IQ, or
        intelligence quotient, measures cognitive abilities such as logical
        reasoning, problem-solving skills, and analytical thinking. In contrast,
        EQ focuses on emotional and social skills, including empathy,
        self-awareness, and interpersonal communication. While IQ is important
        for academic and professional success, EQ is equally essential for
        personal growth, emotional well-being, and the ability to collaborate
        and connect with others.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Will Be Increasing My EQ and Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        To enhance my EQ, I plan to practice mindfulness and self-reflection
        regularly. This involves paying attention to my emotional responses and
        understanding their triggers. Additionally, I will engage in active
        listening (listening and looping) to improve my interactions with
        others. To boost neuroplasticity, I will challenge my brain with new
        activities and learning experiences, such as codewars and codedex.
