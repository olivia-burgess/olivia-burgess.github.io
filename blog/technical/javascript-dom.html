        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
      </h2>
      <p>
        An analogy for JavaScript and its relationship with HTML and CSS is like
        a Rubik's Cube. In this analogy for Rubix cube:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML</strong> is like the structure and essential elements to
        create the cube for example there should be 26 distinct cubes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CSS</strong> is like the appearance of the cube, specifying the
        color and arrangement of the squares making the puzzle visually
        appealing and distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally: <strong>JavaScript</strong> is like the mechanism that
        allows you to twist and turn the Rubik's Cube. It enables interactivity
        and dynamic changes, allowing you to manipulate the cube's squares and
        work towards solving the puzzle. Just as the ability to move and rotate
        the cube is crucial for solving it, JavaScript adds interactivity and
        dynamic behavior to the webpage, responding to user actions and creating
        a more engaging and responsive experience.

      <h2>
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
      </h2>
      <h3>Control Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow allows us to finely manage how our code executes. For
        instance, consider the decision-making process of deciding when to eat
        lunch. There are several factors to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Am I hungry?</li>
        <li>What time is it?</li>
        <li>When did I last eat?</li>
        <li>And so on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these factors acts as a condition. By setting up conditions, we
        can determine if it's time for lunch based on specific criteria. This
        simplifies decision-making significantly. For example, if the condition
        "Am I hungry?" is true, then it's lunchtime—no need to think about the
        other conditions like time or last meal. This streamlined approach saves
        time and mental effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if I'm not hungry, we might want to check other conditions. For
        instance, if I'm following a dietary schedule for exercise to ensure
        adequate protein intake, in this scenario, time of day could be another
        condition to consider if the hunger condition is false. This level of
        control allows us to precisely dictate the flow of actions based on
        varying circumstances, providing a granular approach to decision-making
        in coding.
      </p>

      javascript"
      />
      <p>
        Another thing I will share is an interesting video I watched on YouTube
        which uses conditionals for a game called FizzBuzz. It is a worthwhile
        watch:

      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to loops, you might have heard the phrase "stuck in a
        loop," well I recently learnt this can happen to computers too. However,
        loops can be incredibly useful. They provide precise control over when
        to start, repeat and stop a task to achieve a desired outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider folding laundry as an example. Imagine you have a certain
        number of items to fold, and each item is folded individually. Using a
        loop for folding clothes means repeating the process for each item—each
        repetition is an iteration. You continue folding until all items are
        added to your folded pile. Of course, once all items are folded, you
        don't want to keep folding nothing. That's when you exit the loop.
      </p>
      <p>An example of this in Javascript can look like:</p>

        src="../../images/JavaScript_Editor_loop.png"

      <h2>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a way for JavaScript to interact
        with HTML. The browser provides the document object model as part of the
        window object. It's akin to Google Translate in that it bridges
        communication between different languages. JavaScript doesn't inherently
        understand HTML, so the DOM translates HTML into a format JavaScript can
        comprehend. This is called the tree structure, here is a diagram of
        that:
      </p>
      <img src="../../images/dom-tree.png" alt="diagram on dom tree" />
      <p>
        Using this tree structure, JavaScript can dynamically modify HTML
        content, adding elements or altering existing ones, which is both
        efficient and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with Html and Javascript, these are some ways you can
        interact with the DOM:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Including script tags directly within HTML files.</li>
        <li>Linking to external JavaScript files from HTML documents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another way can be in developer tools, here you can perform actions like
        console.log to debug or explore elements directly.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are indexed, objects are not. Array elements can only be accessed
        by using indexer accessing (bracket notation). Objects can contain
        properties and methods that can either be accessed via bracket notation
        or using dot notation. Furthermore, objects can be descruturced to
        access properties and methods.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are self-contained blocks of code that can be reused. They can
        be called (invoked) and often require parameters to perform specific
        operations or computations. Each function has its own scope and can be
        declared within another scope. Functions are valuable because they
        promote code reuse, helping us avoid redundancy. Additionally, they
        improve code readability by allowing us to break down large blocks of
        code into manageable, understandable parts.
